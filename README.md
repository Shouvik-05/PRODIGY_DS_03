# Bank Marketing Dataset - Decision Tree Prediction  

This project is part of a **Machine Learning practice task** using the **Bank Marketing Dataset**.  

## 📌 Objective  

To build and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** on the Bank Marketing dataset for predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on demographic and campaign-related features.  

## 📁 Files Included  

- `Bank_Marketing_DecisionTree.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all code, training, and predictions  
- `bank-full.csv` – Original dataset (UCI Repository)  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## 📊 Key Explorations & Results  

- Data inspection, cleaning, and preprocessing (Label Encoding for categorical features)  
- Model training with **Decision Tree Classifier (Entropy Criterion)**  
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy (**87.6%**), Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion matrix visualization (Counts + Percentages)  
- Decision tree visualization using **Graphviz**  
- Sample customer prediction → **Prediction: Yes (Probability: 100%)**  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Graphviz
